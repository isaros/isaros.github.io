*Art is a strange subject, very hard to define almost as much as intelligence and therefore AI.
Let's mix it up, and dive into those two fascinating concepts to produce Art using Neural Style Transfer.*

I offer you the opportunity to do style transfer on your *own images* from pre-trained models using Google Drive and Google Colab.

We will use code based on [Logan Engstrom's project](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer). The implementation is based on a combination of Gatys' A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Johnson's Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution, and Ulyanov's Instance Normalization.

If you'd like to have a quick overview of how style transfer work you can go through this [blog post](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/).

[Otherwise, It's time to get your hands dirty and make art](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wh_hk2QaT7_2bv0sbZ-lQUtsgXd1BcYU)
