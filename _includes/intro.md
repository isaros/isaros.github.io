I am an AI evangelist and athlete looking for challenges and adventures.
My thirst for knowledge led me to attend Mines Nancy, an acknowledge french engineering school.
I learn there a bunch of sciences, but also how to interact with students from different backgrounds (art, business, engineer) throughout theoretical and hands-on projects.
I choose to focus on Computer Science due to my strong interest in new technologies.
I believe that they will help us facing the topical issues of our century.
After that, I did an exchange at Chalmers University to dig deeper into Machine Learning.
Knowledge which I used on practical cases during my internship at Etsy.com.

Currently, working at the Mantu Lab as a Data Scientist.
